# Basic Checks, Functions & Threads as per the following list : 

#1. Variables for checking EAR.
#2. Variables for detecting if user is asleep.
#3. When the alarm rings, measure the time eyes are being closed.
#4. When the alarm rangs, count the number of times it is rang, and prevent the alarm from ringing continuously.
#5. We should count the time eyes are being opened for data labeling.
#6. Variables for trained data generation and calculation fps.
#7. Detect face & eyes.
#8. Run the cam.
#9. Threads to run the functions in which determine the EAR_THRESH.
